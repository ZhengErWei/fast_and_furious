Traffic Pattern Detection Based on New York Yellow Taxi Dataset

This project looks at causal relationship between several factors and traffic time by using big data technique mapreduce and mpi. Factors include weather, time and location. Different algorithms are also used to predict pair differences in traffic time by using those variables.
